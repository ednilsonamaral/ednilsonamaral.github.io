# Personal website/portfolio/blog  

Here I can write articles with few tips and a little of my knowledge in web development and share with web community. My portfolio can found here.


## English VS Portuguese

* Blog/Articles > Portuguese  
* Portfolio/About/Contact > English


I prefer keep my website/portfolio in English because is a global language. And I can practicing here, my writing.  

In principle, I keep the blog articles in Portuguese.
